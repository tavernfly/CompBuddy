Download [CompBuddy-2.0.3.zip](https://github.com/tavernfly/CompBuddy/releases/download/v2.0.3/CompBuddy-2.0.3.zip)<br/>

*CompBuddy.runtimeconfig.json*<br/>
(If updating from previous version, replace all 4 of the above files)

USE:
----
1. Double-click CompBuddy.exe to run the program
2. Drag the window anywhere on your screen that's convenient
3. Click on the Guild Name and Comp Type to change them
4. Press `CTRL`+`Space` to start/stop the timer (there is no timer for Marks b/c they don't need one)
5. Press '`+`' whenever you do a mark/reward/transaction etc. to increment the count
6. Click on the Gear icon âš™ in the bottom right to change the hotkey
7. When you're done, go to `#staff-comp` and click to hilight the new post field (so it has the flashing `|`)
   Then press `CTRL`+`P` to autofill the post!

![Post your comp with a single hotkey!](https://github.com/tavernfly/compbuddy/blob/master/ss/ss3.png?raw=true)

HOTKEYS:
-------------------
- Increment Counter: `Plus` (DEFAULT, CUSTOMIZABLE)
- Decrement Counter: `ALT`+`Plus` (or `ALT` + above hotkey)
- Timer Start/Stop: `CTRL`+`Space`
- Print Comp: `CTRL`+`P`
- Change Comp Type: `CTRL`+`1`,`2`,`3`...`7`
- Reset Timer: `ALT`+`Space` (asks to confirm)
- Reset EVERYTHING: `ALT`+`C` (Resets all counters and timers for a new session, asks to confirm)
- Hide CompBuddy (minimize/restore): `CTRL`+`H`
   
TIPS'n'TRICKS:
--------------
- You can work on multiple comp types, even multiple guilds at once, and Comp Buddy will keep track of
all of it for you. All Counters and Timers are separate!

- If you go over 99 count for Marks or any comp type, the maximum of 99 will be posted at a time,
and the notes will say "(1 of 2)" etc. Just keep posting until they're all posted! :)

- You can change the increment counter hotkey to (almost) anything you like, including `CTRL` + hotkeys.

- CompBuddy will remember your progress if you have to stop and come back, even if the application is closed!
