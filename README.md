INSTALL:
-------
Download [CompBuddy 2.0.2](https://github.com/tavernfly/CompBuddy/releases/download/v2.0.2/CompBuddy-2.0.2.zip)<br/>
Extract the CompBuddy folder anywhere you like. It just needs these 4 files:
*CompBuddy.exe*
*CompBuddy.dll*
*CompBuddy.deps.json*
*CompBuddy.runtimeconfig.json*

USE:
----
1. Double-click CompBuddy.exe to run the program
2. Drag the window anywhere on your screen that's convenient
3. Click on the Guild Name and Comp Type to change them
4. Press CTRL+Space to start/stop the timer (there is no timer for Marks b/c they don't need one)
5. Press '+' whenever you do a mark/reward/transaction etc. to increment the count
6. Click on the Gear icon âš™ in the bottom right to change the hotkey
7. When you're done, go to #staff-comp and click to hilight the new post field (so it has the flashing '|')
   Then press CTRL+P to autofill the post!
   
HOTKEYS:
-------------------
- Increment Counter: Plus (DEFAULT, CUSTOMIZABLE)
- Decrement Counter: Alt+Plus (or Alt + above hotkey)
- Timer Start/Stop: Ctrl+Space
- Print Comp: Ctrl+P
- Change Comp Type: Ctrl+1,2,3...7
- Reset Timer: Alt+Space (asks to confirm)
- Reset EVERYTHING: Alt+C (Resets all counters and timers for a new session, asks to confirm)
- Hide CompBuddy (minimize/restore): Ctrl+H
   
TIPS'n'TRICKS:
--------------
- You can work on multiple comp types, even multiple guilds at once, and Comp Buddy will keep track of
all of it for you. All Counters and Timers are separate!

- If you go over 99 count for Marks or any comp type, the maximum of 99 will be posted at a time,
and the notes will say "(1 of 2)" etc. Just keep posting until they're all posted! :)

- CompBuddy will remember your progress if you have to stop and come back, even if the application is closed!
